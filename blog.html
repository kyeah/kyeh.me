	We made it. It's happening. Blastro Networks is finally ready to release their 
redesigned, 
rejuvenated android apps, due in large part to the work I did over the summer, and also to the 
less frequent work I've done over the last few school months. Although I have my reservations 
about a few of the design choices made by the company, I understand the immense amount of planning that 
occurs behind the scenes to keep all of their web and mobile apps behaving homogeneously and at a 
high level of polish. Nevertheless, they put a lot of faith in my ability as a novice Android 
developer at the time of my hiring, and I was blessed with an opportunity to lead the redesign and 
rebuilding of their three flagship apps as their sole developer. 
</br></br>
Having come this far, I've learned a ton of things about the Android platform, and I've been 
constantly impressed by the huge amount of support from third-party developers, who provide 
libraries that make complex tasks easy to implement and efficient to run. As an 
Android-developer-in-training, I would often revise old, deprecated code from the older Blastro 
app to make it cleaner and more efficient, only to realize that a library introduced in the past 
year was perfect for the job and could be integrated with just a few adjustments to the existing 
code base. Although it was disappointing to realize the last few hours of work were unnecessary, 
it ultimately allowed me to understand the Android lifecycle and architectures much more clearly, 
and you know what they say – you shouldn't use a tool unless you know how it works, or you'll be 
tearing your hair out when problems arise.
</br></br>
A lot of the UI flow I was asked to implement by my technical advisors involved modifying standard 
Android and third-party classes, and my past failures and successes working at an unnecessarily 
low level made it easy to understand how these classes interacted with the Android state and what 
their limitations were. While modifying the MediaController class to provide a custom video player 
controller, I was surprised by some of the haphazard logic in the standard controller, and had to 
fix several bugs regarding video connections and the play-pause state that occurred whenever the 
surface state was changed – an event triggered by things like orientation changes and keyboard 
layout accommodations. 
</br></br>
One of the biggest challenges was modifying ListViews and GridViews to get the proper behavior to 
take place on the main artist and video browsers, where a single list holds sorted list results, a 
large carousel of featured items, and a scrolling/sticky button bar, all interconnected but with 
different behaviors and layout needs from within the view. You can note one glaring problem with 
my solution in grid mode, where the GridView will often recycle the carousel view and not be able 
to recognize its need to be redrawn. However, these types of graphical issues only seem to crop up 
on certain devices, such as the Galaxy SIII, and a lot of care was made to limit fragmentation 
issues before release.
</br></br>
Although portions of the UI flow were requested by my advisors, the UI design itself was decidedly 
in my hands, and they trusted me to bring an updated Holo style to their apps while retaining an 
overall feel similar to the iOS app. The first rough version of the app followed the iOS app very 
closely, but as I grew more comfortable with Android design patterns and the way resources are 
interconnected, I was able to develop my own custom styles for various portions of the app and 
remodel its look and feel to be snappier and more eye-catching.
</br></br>
Overall, I'm happy with the way the apps came out, and I was able to dip myself into almost every 
aspect of the Android app lifecycle – networking, efficient storage and display of data, 
synchronization of account data, UI design and flow, third-party library integration (including 
social media and ads)...
</br></br>
Look out for the new-look Blastro, Roxwel and Yallwire on the Google Play Store soon, and get 
pumped for eventual Chromecast support.

      <div class="large-10 large-centered columns">
        <h5 style="color:#EEEEEE">I recently switched over to Android Studio after months of 
frustratingly sitting back in my chair while Eclipse plinked around, cleaning and building the 
project every 
time I 
changed a few lines of code.</br></br>
Thank god. 
</br></br>
This is my first encounter with an IDE from JetBrains. It's cleaner, faster, and it just feels 
good to work with. <i>It feels right.</i> I don't have to tinker around with the 3 perspectives I 
want and the 15 others that get in the way; I don't have to slow my IDE down with plugins for vital functionality; I don't have to wade through menus to fix dependencies and all the other miscellaneous things that go wrong in Eclipse. Android Studio comes in hot. It does what you want, when you want. It makes sense.
</br></br>
Android Studio is a joint effort between Google and JetBrains, and is built on JetBrain's IntelliJ IDEA. Despite being in early access preview, it manages to be better than Eclipse in just about every way possible. It's like that new kid in school with a fresh leather jacket and well-trimmed pompadour who manages to steal all the popular kids' crewmates and girlfriends before simultaneously revealing his 1964 Aston Martin and dropping the pants of everyone in a 5-mile radius. 
</br></br>
Or something like that.
</br></br>
One of my favorite things about AS is how dynamic it is: color previews appear instantaneously and you can view the layout of your app on a number of different devices without ever compiling the project. I often found myself waiting for Eclipse whenever I wanted to test and compare different colors and positions, and I've probably wasted several hours nudging padding and weights to make it perfect. While I enjoy getting paid to reddit during compilation, sometimes a man just needs to see the damn thing work so he can move on to more important matters.
</br></br>
My only complaint is the Logcat viewer. The only way to stop auto-scrolling to the most recent log is to click your way through an error, which automatically opens up the offending file. While I do appreciate the effort, it ends up being a nuisance to work with. There also appears to be some slowdown when attaching the debugger, which wasn't there when using Eclipse. Hopefully we'll see some improvements with Logcat going forward, but Android Studio manages to blow Eclipse away so completely in every other category that it's hard to imagine going back. 
</br></br>
In Google and JetBrains I believe.

	 Early morning nonsense post; ignore. thank you.</br><!--/br>Hello, blog. After months of neglecting my side-projects, I found myself wrapped up in my headphones at four o'clock in the morning, questioning the past two weeks of stewing in my own pity and despair and coming down with a severe urge to make something respectable of myself before the sun rose. 
</br></br>
Two hours later, I'd managed to fool around with the Foundation javascript files and import lightboxes, albeit with a minor crisis in how much example code should find its way into my own codebase. I had originally planned a black-and-white layout for my personal site, but this dark checkerboard pattern seems quite nice and homely -- looking at a white background in total darkness is never pleasant. The green font colors may need to be changed, but overall, the example CSS is a good base for variation. I try to stray from simply importing and using code -- understand it and modify it to fit your needs, or rebuild it entirely if it's just not malleable enough, because sometimes building your own tools is a lot easier than working with a pre-made one.
</br></br>
Looking at the design of the site again, I decided to extend the "Hello" intro bar across the entire row. This has a double-whammy effect of naturally drawing eyes towards the three icons on the right while making the Github octocat stand out against the grey background, making visitors more likely to take a look at my code base and LinkedIn. I feel more like an OCD designer than a programmer when working on this website, but I should be learning some javascript in the next few weeks to help jumpstart my brain. I'll be looking to inject some life into the site with a custom last.fm ticker to show a live feed of my most recently played songs on iTunes, but first: project descriptions. And an actual blog infrastructure.
