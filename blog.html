    <h2>HELLO, BLOG</h2>
    <p>May 24, 2013</p>
    <div class="large-10 large-centered columns">
    <h5 style="color:#FFFFFF">Hello, blog. After months of neglecting my side-projects, I found myself wrapped up in my headphones at four o'clock in the morning, questioning the past two weeks of stewing in my own pity and despair and coming down with a severe urge to make something respectable of myself before the sun rose. 
</br></br>
Well, here I am. Two hours later and I've managed to fool around with the Foundation javascript files and import lightboxes, albeit with that familiar moral crisis of how much example code should find its way into my own codebase. I had originally planned a black-and-white layout for my personal site, but this dark checkerboard pattern seems quite nice and homely -- looking at a white background in total darkness is never pleasant. The green font colors may need to be changed, but overall, the example CSS is a good base for variation. I try to stray from simply importing and using code -- learn it, understand it, and modify it to fit your needs, or rebuild it entirely if it's just not malleable enough, because sometimes building your own damn tools is a lot easier than working with a pre-made one.
</br></br>
Looking at the design of the site again, I decided to extend the "Hello" intro bar across the entire row. This has a double-whammy effect of naturally drawing eyes towards the three icons on the right while making the Github octocat stand out against the grey background, making visitors more likely to take a look at my code base and LinkedIn. It's the little things. I feel more like an OCD designer than a programmer when working on this website, but I should be learning some javascript in the next few weeks to help jumpstart my brain into motion. I'll be looking to inject some life into the site with a custom last.fm ticker to show a live feed of my most recently played songs on iTunes, but first: project descriptions. And an actual blog infrastructure. And glorious, glorious pancakes, because the sun is now up. Hello, sunlight.
