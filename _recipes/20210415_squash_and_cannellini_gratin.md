A sweet, buttery bake with crispy pockets of cheese and savory bread. Simple and open to experimentation.

From: [Anna Jones](http://annajones.co.uk/recipe/butternut-cannellini-gratin)

SERVES 6 / 30min prep / 40min bake

- 1 large red onion
- 400-500g squash (about half a veg)
- 400g (1 can or box) of cannellini beans
- 125ml hot vegetable stock
- 3 thick slices of sourdough bread (or focaccia, etc.)
- 50-100g Gruyère cheese
- 1 lemon (optional)

Preheat your oven to 400°C and get PUMPED.

Roughly slice the onions and cut the squash into large dice if you take a while to slice squash...like me. Discard the seeds and keep the peel.

Put a wide, deep pan on medium/medium-high heat, add a drizzle of olive oil and fry the onions until getting soft and sweet, about 4-5 minutes.

Add diced squash to the softened onions and provide another drizzle of oil. Continue cooking, stirring occasionally, until the squash has softens and begins to colour; this will take about 10 minutes.

Season with salt and black pepper and take off the heat. Add the drained cannellini beans and mix.

Pour into a medium-sized baking dish and add in the stock, then tear the bread over the top and press the pieces evenly into the mix. Grate or distribute slices of Gruyère. Bake for 35–40 minutes, until the cheese has melted and the stock is bubbling around the edges. About 5 minutes before done, feel free to grate over parmesan for extra crisp.
