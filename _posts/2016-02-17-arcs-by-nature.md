I’ve been learning to use a pen, lately.

I thought I knew how to use one, but years of slurred letters and trembling lines proved otherwise. The pencil smudges should have tipped me off, long before the first words arrived, but instead of fixing the method of construction, I internalized the sloppiness of my results and eventually stopped using physical pen and paper altogether.

It’s a digital world, now, so that’s accepted. Penmanship is admired, but not quite valued in our new, fast-paced information age. Words are a method of information transfer, and clarity and conciseness are our key values. Pictures are a means to an end; they’re diagrams and models, not an expression in itself. They used to form maps of the internal and unexplainable — things that could only be visualized in that hazy, gaseous abyss of the mind — but now they’re used to describe and simplify in logical terms. Instead of interpreting ideas, we’re describing them.

If you’re a developer, most of what you do may not even be related to the written word, to communication. Our language is mathematical, and the expression of our thoughts and semantics are limited by our syntactic boundaries. We use words and symbols (drawings!) as a means to something usable and understandable, not provoking and infinitely-interpretable. We deal in self-made systematic boxes, and every year someone comes along to move people into a new box.

We’ve systemized our communication, but our thoughts have never been as rational.

I’ve become increasingly focused on one thing over the past few years: improving my grasp of technology, in all its forms. It feels easy, now — to consider a project and visualize the components I need to make it happen. But I look back on the things I dabbled in years ago — illustration, design, writing, percussion — and they were no less difficult than coding at the time — just different. Technology became second nature, when it easily could have been film, journalism, photography. I placed myself securely in tech, but it feels limiting — like I’ve enclosed myself in a box. 

It seems like I’m distracted from that which my skills exist to best serve. Humanity has always been a triumph of creativity, a mushy bag of irrationality  and emotion, and to give in to logic for the purpose of building reasoning systems is to ignore what humans do best: think, dream, and provoke in a more primitive and expressive language than any logical language could express — to evoke emotions, prompt reactions, and start conversations with other human beings.

Art is provocative. It's an idea. It starts as an expression, an outlet in the creator’s mind, and it ends as an experience in the mind of the audience. It’s a concoction of neurons firing, of emotions flaring, of ideas and relations and nostalgia and recognition bubbling up. Art means nothing until it is experienced and interpreted by the audience. Art is nothing without a reaction, a feeling, a conversation between a creator and its witness. It’s a manifestation of your emotions, your state of being, your experiences, and your ever-evolving ideology.

Code is code. It does what it does, and exists as it is. You may think of better ways to do something, of features that are missing, but code stands on its own, even if no one observes it. Code is a tool. A versatile tool that touches and affects every sector. Code can strike up a conversation about semantics, ease of use, utility and scalability, interaction, productivity. But it says nothing of raw human emotion. Its impersonal. 

Every person has a unique connection to a piece of art, but code is code, it does what it does, and it does it the same way every time. Tools don’t change as you change — it’s an expression of its creator, a functional whole presented to you as the culmination of its original environment, and if you don’t align with that original ideology or philosophy, you reject it and find one that does or create your own. 

Technology is a tool that touches and contributes to every other field and industry, and the possibilities for integrating technology into everyday life is limited only by the ingenuity of those creators that can identify existing pain points in their pursuits. Technology has a valuable role to play, but it shouldn’t be an end in itself — a means of replicating or replacing humanity. It should be a means of augmenting it, of sharing ideas, of collaborating — of communicating.

I’ve never thought about the friction of pen on paper until recently. I’ve never thought about the shape and angle of a point, the flow of ink, the mechanics of fingertips and shoulder joints. I’ve never noticed the strain of keeping your palm on the desk, the battle between natural arcs of the wrist and aspirations for straighter lines, the constant competing forces that introduce fine points of chaotic action and reaction with every stroke. In this universe, the way you write is a manifestation of your mental and emotional state — varying forces competing for your attention. The polarizing forces become second-nature, a law of physics — a habitual handicap.

I’m only now finding the freedom and control of movement that comes with holding a pen the right way. Keeping the side of my palm up, keeping the pen pointed high, scaling the set of movements with the breadth of my line, from my fingertips and wrists to my elbows and shoulders. Stamping your palm on the desk causes you to pivot — to naturalize two directions of movement: forward and backward. Lifting your palm removes those boundaries and gives you the mobility to move in other directions. It can feel unruly at times — chaotic and uncontrollable — but it allows your hand to operate in total control, unopposed by constraining forces.

When you’ve been doing something for years, when something has been ingrained into your system, when you don’t even consider the possibility of uprooting your habits and making a change in your mechanics, it can be hard to resist complacency and explore new territories.

I’ve always been good at following the arc. To get better, I need to find new lines of expression.

<h3-dark style="color: #DB6837">A Better Conversation</h3-dark>

I’ve known artists and filmmakers and screenwriters, dancers and musicians and photographers and philosophers, but it’s been a long time since I’ve really talked to any of them. It’s been a long time since I’ve picked their brains. It’s been a long time since I’ve felt connected to them. 

Yet I still get glimpses of them through their work. I view their art and get a feel for where they are — I take the things they put out and make my own interpretations of them. I understand it in the context of my own mental state, my own memories and feelings and experiences and lives. It evokes something primal, and another small piece of my world view is carved out. I have small, personal conversations with them through the things they create, and those conversations change in the same way that I change every single day.

When I was younger, I had a lot of different paths to draw from. I grew complacent with one, but computers haven’t made the best company, and certainly haven’t inspired meaningful thoughts or dialogue of their own philosophical initiative. There are no alternative interpretations of code; you read code to understand the logic and intentions of its creator.

I've learned to communicate logically and diagraphically, but beautiful code still makes for terrible conversation.

With graduation coming up, it feels like the perfect time to revisit those paths — to stray from my arc as a technologist and focus on my arc as a human being.

Maybe, by the end of all this, I’ll know how to use a pen.
