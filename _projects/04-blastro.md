Blastro&rsquo;s flagship Android apps, now available in the Play Store.


As the sole developer, I worked with most aspects of Android development, including low-level optimization of the REST API, bitmap-caching, and networking procedures, efficient storage and display of data, synchronization of account data, UI/UX design and flow, video player design, and third-party library integration (incl. social media and video advertising).
