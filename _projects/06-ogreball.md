A loving recreation of Super Monkey Ball in Ogre3D with 4-player networked matchmaking support, built in five weeks for UT Austin&rsquo;s Game Technology course.

Implements a fully-featured dynamic level and mesh-building scripting language, single-player leaderboards, 4-player online matchmaking, and Gamecube controller support.
