A basic 3D fluid solver implementing the stable Navier-Stokes fluid methods described in Jos Stam&rsquo;s Stable Fluids paper.

This implementation does not use the speed and accuracy optimizations mentioned in the paper, such as FFT and Vorticity Confinement, but instead uses Gauss-Seidel iterative relaxation methods to avoid expensive linear system solvers.
