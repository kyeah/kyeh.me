Genetic Reproduction and Evolution of Aesthetically-Pleasing Attractor Fractals.


A research tool studying the generation and evolution of aesthetically-pleasing fractals. It uses crowd-sourced testing along with observational patterns in the mathematical structure of attractor fractals to find optimal constants and equations.
