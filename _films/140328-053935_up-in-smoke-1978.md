Let's be honest: Cheech and Chong make films for stoners, and although this first outing probably would've been better had I been high off my rocker, it is still the _definitive_ stoner flick. There is no drama or tension, no true conflict or moral of the story; if it had a plot, it certainly fell to the wayside by the 5 minute mark. This film is about two stoners who ride high and bang chicks, with scene after scene of ridiculous situations and nonstop fun. _Up in Smoke_ starts off with probably the best sequence of the movie -- an extended scene of our two protagonists toking up in a beat up car -- then rolls onward to stranger and stranger situations, ending before you know it. 96 minutes of weed, weed trucks, and weed-based decisions.
