I write for film and code for good. You can [find my resume here](kyehresume.pdf). If you'd like to gossip with me about technology for society, films and anxiety, or that one movie where Audrey Hepburn plays a blind woman, contact me at [kevinyeah@utexas.edu](mailto:kevinyeah.stuy@utexas.edu).

about: "

I'm a backend systems developer and sometimes-Android developer with a bit of Rust fanboyism thrown in. I've worked at the systems level in C, done [Graphics](https://github.com/kyeah/Genetic-Fractals) and [Physical Simulation](https://github.com/kyeah/Cloth-Fluids-Solver) work and research in C++ and OpenGL, developed [Computer Vision](https://github.com/kyeah/Nomad) applications using OpenCV, and worked on an assortment of projects in [Python](https://github.com/kyeah/Tweeting-Rainbow), [Perl](https://github.com/kyeah/Six-Degrees-of-Kevin-Bacon), Ruby, Java, Javascript, [Scala](https://github.com/kyeah/geotrellis/tree/feature/cassandra), [Golang](https://github.com/kyeah/Gohunt), [Rust](https://github.com/kyeah/kick-rs)...the works.

<br>
<br>

In the past, I've worked as an Android developer for early-stage, IBM Watson-funded startup [Cerebri](http://cerebri.com/) and as a software engineering intern at [MongoDB](https://mongodb.com/), architecting and actively maintaining their [Rust driver](https://github.com/mongodb-labs/mongo-rust-driver-prototype). I've also worked for [GeoTrellis](http://geotrellis.io/) as a Facebook Open Academy engineer, for [Amazon AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) on their distributed RDS and DynamoDB technologies, and for local Austin company [Blastro Networks](http://www.blastronetworks.com/), developing and orchestrating a simultaneous release of their three flagship Android apps.

I was responsible for overseeing projects to improve the hacker experience at HackTX in 2015, including 3D-printed trophies, [a Slack mentorship system](https://github.com/hacktx/slack-mentorship), [a voting system for LEDs and the Hacker's Choice award](https://github.com/hacktx/particle-power), [an interactive infographic](https://github.com/hacktx/infographic), and [a hardware hack room](https://github.com/hacktx/hackroom).
